          <h1>Q: Why the name?</h1>
          <p>
            A: For as long as I can remember I have always wanted to visit a
            fjord. I also love the name and saying it correctly always freaks
            people out here in the states (said like Fyord). So when it was time
            to name the project I thought “well fjord and board rhyme…” and
            there you go.
          </p>
          <h1>Q: Why the odd layout?</h1>
          <p>
            A: TLDR: because of my needs. Since I got into this hobby about two
            years ago I have only had 75% boards. I can’t live with any smaller
            ones since I use F and arrow keys quite often and I like a lot of
            mouse space so TKL and larger is out. But I don’t use the prtSc,
            Pause, Ins, End, PgUp, and PgDn keys. They end up regularly getting
            in my way. I started this project thinking I could naively think I
            could save a buck by designing a custom case for a PCB I had just
            for myself. Learn CAD and 50 bucks of CNC later boom fancy new KB
            right? No. So you see that I really designed the core idea around
            (almost) exactly what I use and what I use only. When I realized it
            was stupid to do a one-off I was talking to my dad (an audio guy)
            and he suggested that I put a slide pot on the large blocker. I
            thought it would be funny and a bit of a gimmick but eventually I
            came back around and realized it was a great idea. There is a long
            but actually brief explanation of how this layout came to be.

          <h1>Q: Why no knobs?</h1>
          <p>
            A: Personally I think knobs are cool but overused. I get that they
            are more space-efficient than a slider but a slider also gives you a
            very different user experience than a knob.
          </p>
          <h1>Q: Will there be more?</h1>
          <p>
            A: Yes! I don’t plan on stopping; this is just the first of many
            cool things to some!
          </p>
          <h1>Q: Will you release plate or other files?</h1>
          <p>
            A: Partial yes. I will release plate files Because I am only
            providing an Fr4 plate option. As for other files, I will release
            slider handle files so you can make custom handles.
          </p>
